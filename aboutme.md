###This is an excutive summary of CPP528 Final Project
Building a Neighborhood Change Database: In this project we built models to explain neighborhood change between 1990 and 2010. Census data is integral to this analysis, using the harmonized Longitudinal Tracts Data Base. We have selected variables that we thought were potential indicators of gentrification, tested these variables, and also included federal program models###.
